[<b>Non-API</b>] Provides a template implementation of the main ODA run-time interfaces.
These classes assume the behavior of a simple ODA driver,
and have labelled TODO tasks for a driver developer to 
implement data source dependent behavior.
These concrete classes are provided for use as templates or 
base classes to aid in the development of an ODA custom driver.  
Their use is purely optional.
